## Introduction

This is the "plan9-hugo-theme" a theme that has been entirely based off the [plan9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) operating system.

## Instructions
```
hugo new site new-site
cd new-site
git clone https://github.com/spleunker/plan9-hugo-theme themes/plan9
cp -r themes/plan9/ExampleSite/* .
rm -rf themes/plan9/ExampleSite
```

## Credits
This Hugo these probably wouldn't have even existed if it weren't for this theme; really helped me get down with the basics. I would totally recommend this for any beginners that are getting into making their own Hugo theme.
